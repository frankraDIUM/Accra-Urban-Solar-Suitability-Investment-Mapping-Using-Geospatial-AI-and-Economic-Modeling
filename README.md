# 🌞 Building-Level-Solar-Suitability-Mapping-in-Urban-Ghana
**Accra Solar Rooftop Suitability & Investment Dashboard**
A geospatial AI pipeline for building-level solar potential assessment in Central Accra, Ghana.



1. Project Objective
Develop a scalable geospatial AI pipeline to:

Detect and characterize individual building rooftops
Assess solar suitability per building using roof geometry and environmental factors
Estimate annual solar energy generation (kWh)
Calculate economic viability (payback period and Net Present Value)
Deliver an interactive dashboard for decision-makers

2. Study Area

Location: Central Accra, Ghana
Scope: Pilot area covering 632,195 buildings
Focus: Dense urban environment with high solar potential and unreliable grid power

3. Methodology & Pipeline
Phase 1: Building Footprints

Combined Google Open Buildings and Microsoft Global Building Footprints datasets
Filtered to central Accra bounding box
Final dataset: 632,195 building polygons

Phase 2: Elevation Analysis

Used Copernicus DEM GLO-30
Derived slope and aspect rasters
Extracted per-building slope and aspect

Phase 3: Solar Irradiance

Fetched NASA POWER data (2020–2025)
Annual GHI: 1,779 kWh/m²/year (used as reference for methodology justification)

Phase 4: Rooftop Geometry & Suitability

Calculated accurate footprint area in UTM Zone 30N
Introduced roof utilization factor based on slope
Developed weighted suitability score (0–100):
Slope: 45%
Aspect: 30%
Usable area: 25%

Added nonlinear area scoring with diminishing returns

Phase 5: Energy Generation & Economic Analysis

Realistic per-kW yield: 1,280 kWh/kW/year (derived from NASA GHI with local derating)
System sizing with practical cap (max 35 kW)
Cost model: fixed baseline + variable per kW + bulk discount for larger systems
Included self-consumption rate (65%), O&M costs, and panel degradation (0.6%/year)
Calculated:
Annual energy generation
Simple payback period
Net Present Value (NPV) using 8.5% discount rate over 25 years


Final Results:

Average payback period: 7.0 years
Average NPV: +55,594 GHS per building
Positive NPV rate: 81.5% (515,007 buildings)
Total Year-1 generation potential: 6,122 GWh/year

Phase 6: Interactive Dashboard

Built with Streamlit
Features:
Dynamic filters (suitability score, payback period, NPV)
Interactive map with clustering and legend
Distribution charts
Economic insights
Top 20 investment opportunities
CSV download of filtered results


4. Technologies Used

Python, GeoPandas, Rasterio, Folium, Streamlit, Plotly
NASA POWER API, Copernicus DEM
Google Earth Engine (for initial building footprints)

5. Key Files Produced

accra_buildings_solar_roi_final.gpkg — Main geospatial dataset (632,195 buildings)
accra_solar_final_summary.csv — Clean tabular summary
08_streamlit_dashboard.py — Interactive web dashboard

6. Key Insights

Solar rooftop systems show strong economic viability across most of central Accra.
Roof slope and usable area are the dominant factors influencing suitability and returns.
Realistic modeling (self-consumption, degradation, O&M) significantly impacts payback and NPV.
The pipeline is modular and scalable to other urban areas in Ghana.
